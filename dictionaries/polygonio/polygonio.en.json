    "Polygon.io is a web game created as part of the \"Advanced Software Engineering\" course at Ã‰cole des Mines de Nancy.",
    "The aim of this project was to create a web application using api. We chose to create a multi-player web game, inspired by the style of the game ",
    "In this game, players embody polygons and must shoot down other players to gain experience and evolve into a larger polygon. (An n-sided polygon can shoot n projectiles.) Players can also collect experience bubbles on the map or life bubbles to heal themselves. A gauge representing the number of bullets in their magazine is also present. Finally, a player ranking, a minimap and a text chat are displayed in real time.",
    "The source code for this project is available on ",
    " The game is no longer deployed so as not to incur hosting costs."
